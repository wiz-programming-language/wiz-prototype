# Wiz prototype
Python implementation of Wiz.

The purpose of Wiz is to make programming easier and faster to learn for beginners and more accessible by reducing it's language barrier. This would be achieved by being simple and intuitive and by having a syntax, error messages and entire ecosystem avalaible in many different human languages. The code would be translatable and could be run using a syntax with the language preferred by the user.

Currently very much a work in progress. Syntax available in English and Portuguese but translations for all texts not done yet.

## Try it out
_Requires Python 3.13._

First, get the code for the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/wiz-programming-language/wiz-prototype.git```

At the root directory use this to run the interactive shell:

To run a file, add an argument to the command with it's path:
